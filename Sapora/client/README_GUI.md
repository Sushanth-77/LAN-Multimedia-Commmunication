Modern Zoom-like desktop interface for the Sapora LAN video conferencing application.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the GUI, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 opencv-python numpy pyaudio pyautogui
```

### Package Breakdown:
- **PyQt6** - GUI framework
- **opencv-python** (cv2) - Video capture and processing
- **numpy** - Array operations for video frames
- **pyaudio** - Audio capture and playback
- **pyautogui** - Screen capture for screen sharing

## 🚀 How to Launch

### 1. Start the Server

First, start the server on the host machine (or locally for testing):

```bash
cd C:\Users\SUSHANTH\OneDrive\Desktop\CN_PROJECT\sapora\Sapora
python server/server_main.py
```

The server will start and listen on all configured ports (video, audio, chat, file transfer, screen share).

### 2. Start the Client GUI

On the same or different machine(s), launch the PyQt6 client:

```bash
cd C:\Users\SUSHANTH\OneDrive\Desktop\CN_PROJECT\sapora\Sapora
python client/main_ui.py
```

### 3. Join the Meeting

A login dialog will appear:

1. **Enter Server IP**: 
   - For local testing: `127.0.0.1`
   - For LAN: Enter the server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   
2. **Enter Your Name**: Type your username

3. Click **"Join Meeting"**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- **Error**: "Camera unavailable. Try closing other video apps."
- **Solution**: Close any apps using the webcam (Zoom, Teams, browser tabs, etc.)
- **Windows Specific**: Check camera privacy settings

### Audio Issues
- **No Sound**: Check system volume and ensure correct audio device selected
- **Echo**: Lower speaker volume or use headphones
- **PyAudio Errors**: Reinstall with `pip install --upgrade pyaudio`

### Connection Failed
- Verify server is running
- Check firewall settings (ports 5000-5003, 6000-6001)
- Ensure correct server IP address
- Try pinging the server: `ping <server_ip>`

### Import Errors
```bash
# If PyQt6 not found:
pip install PyQt6

# If cv2 not found:
pip install opencv-python

# If pyaudio not found:
pip install pyaudio
```
