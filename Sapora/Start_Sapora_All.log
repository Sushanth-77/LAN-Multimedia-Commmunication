ERROR: Cannot install -r C:\Users\SUSHANTH\OneDrive\Desktop\CN_2TESTING\Sapora\Sapora\requirements.txt (line 8) because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    pyqt6 6.10.0 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.11.0 and >=6.10.0
    pyqt6 6.9.1 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.10.0 and >=6.9.0
    pyqt6 6.9.0 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.10.0 and >=6.9.0
    pyqt6 6.8.1 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.9.0 and >=6.8.0
    pyqt6 6.8.0 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.9.0 and >=6.8.0
    pyqt6 6.7.1 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.8.0 and >=6.7.0
    pyqt6 6.7.0 depends on PyQt6-Qt6<6.8.0 and >=6.7.0
    pyqt6 6.6.1 depends on PyQt6-Qt6>=6.6.0
    pyqt6 6.6.0 depends on PyQt6-Qt6>=6.6.0
    pyqt6 6.5.3 depends on PyQt6-Qt6>=6.5.0
    pyqt6 6.5.2 depends on PyQt6-Qt6>=6.5.0
    pyqt6 6.5.1 depends on PyQt6-Qt6>=6.5.0
    pyqt6 6.5.0 depends on PyQt6-Qt6>=6.5.0

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    pyqt6-qt6

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
